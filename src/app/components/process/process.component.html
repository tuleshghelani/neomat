        <h2>Investment Casting Process</h2>
        <p>Investment casting is a complex process where a molten metal is poured into a ceramic shell to create small, precise metal components.
          <br>Its original name "lost wax casting," refers to the original wax pattern the ceramics are formed around, then melted and <br>replaced with alloys of stainless steel, aluminum, cobalt, carbon steel, brass, bronze, and other metals.</p>

      <h2>Forging Process</h2>
      <p>Forging is a manufacturing process that involves shaping metal into a desired shape using compressive forces like hammering, pressing, or rolling. 
        <br>The process can be performed at different temperatures, including cold, warm, or hot. Forging is used to create parts that are stronger and
        <br> more durable than other metalworking processes, and are often used in critical applications</p>

      <p>Although forging blanks have tighter tolerances than casting ones, occasionally, 
      <br>this is still 
      insufficient for application. To solve this concern, machining is required. 
      <br>The NC lathe and CNC are the primary machining tools used. 
      <br>While CNC is used for precise, expensive machining, NC lathes are utilized for simple machining.
